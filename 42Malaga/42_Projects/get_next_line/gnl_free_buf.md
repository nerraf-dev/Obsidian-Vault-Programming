 `gnl_free_buf`: frees a dynamically allocated buffer and set its pointer to `NULL`. This function is particularly useful in managing memory and preventing memory leaks.

Function Breakdown:

1. **Function Prototype**: 
   ```c
   char *gnl_free_buf(char **buf)
   ```
   The function takes a single argument, `buf`, which is a pointer to a pointer to a character (`char **`). This allows the function to modify the original pointer passed to it.

2. **Freeing Memory**:
   ```c
   free(*buf);
   ```
   The `free` function is called on `*buf`, which deallocates the memory that `*buf` points to. This is for managing dynamically allocated memory and avoiding memory leaks.

3. **Setting Pointer to NULL**:
   ```c
   *buf = NULL;
   ```
   After freeing the memory, the function sets the original pointer to `NULL`. This is a good practice because it ensures that the pointer does not become a dangling pointer, which could lead to undefined behavior if dereferenced.

4. **Return Value**:
   ```c
   return (NULL);
   ```
   The function returns `NULL`. This can be useful if the function is used in a context where the return value is assigned to the original pointer, ensuring it is explicitly set to [`NULL`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Flib%2Fllvm-12%2Flib%2Fclang%2F12.0.1%2Finclude%2Fstddef.h%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A88%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%5D "../../../../../../../usr/lib/llvm-12/lib/clang/12.0.1/include/stddef.h").
