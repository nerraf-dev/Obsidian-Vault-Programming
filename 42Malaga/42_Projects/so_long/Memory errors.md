The latest Valgrind results indicate that the uninitialized memory issue is related to the `writev` system call, which is being triggered by MiniLibX (`mlx_init` and `mlx_new_window`). This issue is not uncommon when using MiniLibX, as it interacts with the X11 library, which may use uninitialized memory internally. Here's how to interpret and address the results:

---

### Key Observations from Valgrind Output:
1. **Uninitialized Memory in `writev`:**
   - The error originates from the `writev` system call, which is used by the X11 library (via MiniLibX).
   - The stack trace shows that the issue occurs during `mlx_new_window`, which is called in your `load_window` function.

2. **No Memory Leaks in Your Code:**
   - Valgrind reports that all heap blocks were freed, meaning your cleanup code is working correctly.
   - The issue is likely caused by MiniLibX or the X11 library, not your code.

3. **Error Context:**
   - The uninitialized memory is 28 bytes inside a block allocated by `calloc` in `XOpenDisplay`. This suggests that the X11 library is not fully initializing some of its internal structures.

---

### Steps to Address the Issue:

#### 1. **Ensure Proper Initialization in Your Code**
Although the issue is likely in MiniLibX or X11, you should double-check that your code is not contributing to the problem. Specifically:
- Ensure that all fields in the `t_game` structure are initialized before being passed to MiniLibX functions.
- Your `init_game` function already initializes `game->mlx` and `game->mlx_win` to `NULL`, which is correct.

#### 2. **Suppress Known MiniLibX Issues**
If the issue is confirmed to be in MiniLibX or X11, and you are confident that your code is not contributing to it, you can suppress the error in Valgrind. Create a suppression file (e.g., `mlx.supp`) with the following content:

```text
{
   MiniLibX writev uninitialized memory
   Memcheck:Param
   writev(vector[0])
   fun:writev
   obj:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.*
   ...
}
```

Run Valgrind with the suppression file:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --suppressions=mlx.supp ./so_long maps/16x16.ber
```

This will suppress the error related to `writev` while still reporting other potential issues.

#### 3. **Use the Latest MiniLibX Version**
Ensure that you are using the latest version of MiniLibX, as newer versions may have fixed this issue. If you are using a custom version of MiniLibX (e.g., for Linux), check the repository for updates or patches.

#### 4. **Document the Issue**
If the issue persists and is confirmed to be caused by MiniLibX or X11, document it in your project. For example, in your README or comments, explain that:
- The uninitialized memory issue is caused by MiniLibX or X11.
- You have ensured that all memory allocated by your code is properly initialized and freed.

#### 5. **Re-run Valgrind with `--track-origins=yes`**
If you haven't already, run Valgrind with the `--track-origins=yes` flag to trace where the uninitialized memory originates. This may provide additional context about the source of the issue:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes ./so_long maps/16x16.ber
```

---

### Conclusion:
The uninitialized memory issue is likely caused by MiniLibX or X11, not your code. You can:
1. Double-check your code for proper initialization.
2. Suppress the error in Valgrind if it is confirmed to be harmless.
3. Document the issue in your project if it cannot be resolved.
