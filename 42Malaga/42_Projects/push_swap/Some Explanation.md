### Initial Setup
- `arr[0]` is [`2`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A64%2C%22character%22%3A31%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition").
- [`offset`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A64%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") is `-1`.

### Iteration Steps
1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - `current = head;` // [`current`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") points to the head of the list.
   - `index = arr[i] + offset;` // `index = 2 + (-1) = 1`.

2. **Inner While Loop (`index > 0`)**:
   - **First Inner Loop Iteration**:
     - `current = current->next;` // Move [`current`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") to the next node.
     - `index--;` // Decrement [`index`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A64%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") by 1.
     - Now, `index = 0`.

3. **Exit Inner While Loop**:
   - The inner while loop exits because [`index`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A64%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") is no longer greater than [`0`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A65%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition").

4. **Increment Count**:
   - `current->count++;` // Increment the [`count`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A70%2C%22character%22%3A11%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") of the current node.

### Explanation
- The inner while loop runs until [`index`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A64%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") becomes [`0`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A65%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition").

- Therefore, [`current`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") ends up pointing to the node that is one step away from the head node.

### Example Linked List
Assume the linked list is as follows:
```
head -> node1 -> node2 -> node3 -> ...
```
- Initially, [`current`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") points to [`head`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition").
- After one iteration of the inner while loop, [`current`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsimon%2FLibrary%2FCloudStorage%2FGoogleDrive-geeky.teacher.cs%40gmail.com%2FMy%20Drive%2F42%2FProjects%2Fpush_swap%2Fsrc%2Flist_utils.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228366d988-0a9a-4de0-8295-a04de7642b66%22%5D "Go to definition") points to `node1`.

### Code with Comments
Here is the code with comments to clarify each step:

```c
while (i < length)
{
    current = head; // Start from the head of the list
    index = arr[i] + offset;  // Calculate index: 2 + (-1) = 1
    while (index > 0)  // Check if index is greater than 0
    {
        current = current->next;  // Move to the next node
        index--; // Decrement index by 1
    }
    current->count++; // Increment the count of the current node
    i++; // Move to the next element in the array
}
```
