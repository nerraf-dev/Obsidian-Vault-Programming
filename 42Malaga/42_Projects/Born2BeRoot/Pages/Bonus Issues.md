To rename a volume group from `sfarren42--vg` to `LVMGroup`, you can use the `vgrename` command. Here are the steps:

1. Ensure no logical volumes are in use.
2. Rename the volume group.
3. Update the `/etc/fstab` and other configuration files if necessary.

Here's the command to rename the volume group:

```shell
sudo vgrename sfarren42--vg LVMGroup
```

After renaming the volume group, you should update any references to the old volume group name in your system configuration files, such as `/etc/fstab` and the initramfs.

1. **Update `/etc/fstab`:**

   Open the file with a text editor:

   ```shell
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   Replace any occurrences of `sfarren42--vg` with `LVMGroup`.

2. **Update the initramfs:**

   Regenerate the initramfs to include the new volume group name:

   ```shell
   sudo update-initramfs -u
   ```

3. **Reboot the system:**

   Finally, reboot your system to apply the changes:

   ```shell
   sudo reboot
   ```

These steps will rename your volume group and ensure your system configuration is updated accordingly.
