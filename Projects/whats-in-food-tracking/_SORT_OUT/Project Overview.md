## Goal:

To create a user-friendly food inventory management application that helps users efficiently track, organise, and manage their household food items. 

**Objectives:**

1. **Product Management:**
    - Allow users to add, edit, and delete food items.
    - Enable users to scan barcodes to automatically fetch product information (e.g., name, expiration date, nutritional information).
    - Provide options to set expiration dates and quantity for each item.
    - Allow users to organise products by location (e.g., fridge, pantry, freezer).
2. **Inventory Tracking:**
    - Display a clear and organised list of food items.
    - Sort items by expiration date, category, or other relevant criteria.
    - Generate shopping lists based on low-stock items or upcoming expiration dates.
    - Track product usage and consumption to help reduce food waste.
3. **User Interface:**
    - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
    - Ensure a smooth user experience on various devices (web, mobile).
    - Provide clear instructions and helpful tips.
4. **Data Security and Privacy:**
    - Implement robust security measures to protect user data.
    - Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
5. **Image Recognition:**
	- **Barcode Scanning:**
	    - Implement barcode scanning functionality using the device's camera.
	    - Automatically fetch product information from a database or API using the scanned barcode.
	- **Image-Based Product Identification:**
	    - Develop an image recognition model to identify food items based on their appearance.
	    - Utilise a pre-trained model or train a custom model using a dataset of food images.
	    - Integrate the image recognition model into the app to automatically add items to the inventory.
6. **Recipe Suggestions:**
	- **Ingredient-Based Recipes:**
	    - Analyse the current inventory and suggest recipes based on available ingredients.
	    - Use a recipe API to fetch relevant recipes.
	- **Personalized Recipe Recommendations:**
	    - Consider user preferences, dietary restrictions, and past recipe usage to provide tailored recommendations.

## Target Audience:

### Primary Target Audience:
