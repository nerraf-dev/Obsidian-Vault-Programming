**You're absolutely right.** Storing multiple values in a single text field can lead to challenges in data retrieval, filtering, and analysis. It's generally better to normalize the data and store each value in a separate row or table.

### Improving the Database Design

Here's a revised database design that addresses the issue of storing multiple values in a single field:

**Products Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    code TEXT UNIQUE,
    product_name TEXT,
    image_url TEXT,
    ingredients TEXT
);
```

**Brands Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE brands (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    brand_name TEXT
);
```

**Product_Brands Junction Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_brands (
    product_id INTEGER,
    brand_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (brand_id) REFERENCES brands(id)
);
```

**Categories Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    category_name TEXT
);
```

**Product_Categories Junction Table:**

```SQL
CREATE TABLE product_categories (
    product_id INTEGER,
    category_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id)
);
```

**Product Quantities Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    location_name TEXT,
    parent_location_id INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE product_quantities (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    product_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER,
    purchase_date DATE,
    expiration_date DATE,
    location_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(id)
);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Products Table:** Stores core product information.
- **Brands Table:** Stores brand names.
- **Product_Brands Junction Table:** Links products to multiple brands.
- **Categories Table:** Stores category names.
- **Product_Categories Junction Table:** Links products to multiple categories.
- **Locations Table:**
    - Stores information about locations, including their hierarchy.
    - `parent_location_id`: A foreign key to itself, allowing you to create a hierarchical structure of locations (e.g., fridge -> fridge door, fridge top shelf).
- **Product Quantities Table:**
    - `location_id`: A foreign key to the `locations` table, linking a specific quantity to a location.

By using junction tables, you can efficiently store multiple brands and categories for each product, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Normalization:** Consider further normalizing the `ingredients` field if you need to analyze specific ingredients or allergens.
- **Indexing:** Create indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `product_code`, `product_name`) to improve query performance.
- **Data Validation:** Implement data validation rules to ensure data consistency.
- **Security:** Protect sensitive information by using appropriate security measures.
