#### **Data Representation:**
**1. Binary Magnitudes:**
   - **Concept:** Understanding the concept of binary magnitudes.
   - **Binary Prefixes:** Difference between binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi) and decimal prefixes (kilo, mega, giga, tera).
   - **Practical Applications:** Examples and use cases of binary magnitudes in computing.

**2. Different Number Systems:**
   - **Binary System:** Explanation and conversion between binary and denary (decimal) systems.
   - **Hexadecimal System:** Explanation, conversion between hexadecimal and binary/denary, and practical applications.
   - **Binary Coded Decimal (BCD):** Explanation and practical examples of BCD.
   - **Character Encoding:** Understanding ASCII, extended ASCII, and Unicode for representing character data.

**3. Binary Addition and Subtraction:**
   - **Addition:** Rules for binary addition, including handling overflow.
   - **Subtraction:** Methods for binary subtraction, including one's complement and two's complement representation.

#### **Multimedia - Graphics:**
**1. Bitmap Image Encoding:**
   - **Bitmap Basics:** Understanding pixels, file headers, image resolution, screen resolution, and color depth (bit depth).
   - **File Size Calculation:** Techniques to estimate the file size of bitmap images based on resolution and color depth.
   - **Quality vs. File Size:** Effect of changing elements like resolution and color depth on image quality and file size.
   - **Practical Exercises:** Create and analyze bitmap images with different resolutions and color depths.

**2. Vector Graphics:**
   - **Vector Graphics Basics:** Explanation of vector graphics, drawing objects, properties, and drawing lists.
   - **Encoding:** How data for a vector graphic is encoded.
   - **Comparison:** Differences between bitmap and vector graphics and their use cases.
   - **Practical Exercises:** Create simple vector graphics and compare their storage requirements to bitmap images.

### Tips for Teaching:
1. **Interactive Lessons:** Use visual aids and interactive tools to explain complex concepts like binary operations and graphics encoding.
2. **Hands-on Practice:** Include exercises where students convert numbers between systems, perform binary arithmetic, and create/analyze images.
3. **Real-world Applications:** Relate theoretical concepts to real-world applications, such as character encoding in text files and the use of different image formats in digital media.
4. **Assessment:** Conduct quizzes and mini-projects to assess students' understanding and reinforce learning.
