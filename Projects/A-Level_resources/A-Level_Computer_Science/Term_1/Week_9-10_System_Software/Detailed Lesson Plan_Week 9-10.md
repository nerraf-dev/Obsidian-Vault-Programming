- **Activity (20 minutes):** Group discussion on the importance of each management task and real-world examples of their applications.
- **Homework (35 minutes):** Research and write a brief report on how different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) handle key management tasks.
- **Flipped Learning:** Assign a video or reading material on the basics of operating systems and their key management tasks.

#### **Day 2: Utility Software and Program Libraries**
**Objective:** Understand the role of utility software and program libraries in an OS.
- **Lecture (25 minutes):** Explanation of typical utility software (disk formatter, virus checker, defragmentation software, disk contents analysis/disk repair software, file compression, back-up software) and the use of program libraries (including Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files).
- **Activity (20 minutes):** Group activity to identify and discuss the functions of various utility software and program libraries.
- **Discussion (15 minutes):** The benefits to developers of using existing code from program libraries.
- **Homework (35 minutes):** Write a short essay on the importance of utility software in maintaining the efficiency and security of a computer system.
- **Flipped Learning:** Provide online tutorials or resources on utility software and program libraries for students to review before the next lesson.

#### **Day 3: Language Translators - Assemblers, Compilers, Interpreters**
**Objective:** Understand the need for assemblers, compilers, and interpreters in translating programming languages.
- **Lecture (25 minutes):** Overview of assemblers, compilers, and interpreters, including their roles, benefits, and drawbacks.
- **Activity (20 minutes):** Hands-on activity to translate a simple high-level language program using an assembler, compiler, and interpreter.
- **Discussion (15 minutes):** Compare and contrast the use of assemblers, compilers, and interpreters in different programming scenarios.
- **Homework (35 minutes):** Research and document the stages involved in the compilation process and the differences between compilation and interpretation.
- **Flipped Learning:** Assign a video tutorial on the functions and benefits of assemblers, compilers, and interpreters.

#### **Day 4: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**
**Objective:** Understand the features of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and their benefits to programmers.
- **Lecture (25 minutes):** Explanation of IDE features (context-sensitive prompts, dynamic syntax checks, prettyprint, expand and collapse code blocks, single stepping, breakpoints, variables, expressions, report window).
- **Activity (20 minutes):** Practical exercise using an IDE to write, debug, and test a simple program.
- **Discussion (15 minutes):** The advantages of using an IDE for programming and how it enhances productivity.
- **Review (10 minutes):** Recap of the week's lessons and key takeaways.
- **Homework (35 minutes):** Create a presentation on the features and benefits of different IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, PyCharm).
- **Flipped Learning:** Share online resources or tutorials on using IDEs for software development.
