### 1. **Complete and Test Core Functionalities**
Ensure that the core functionalities of your timer application are fully implemented and tested. This includes:
- **Timer Controls**: Verify that `startTimer`, `stopTimer`, and `resetTimer` functions are working correctly.
- **Alarm Settings**: Ensure that alarm settings are correctly saved and retrieved.
- **Presets Management**: Implement and test the functionality for adding, updating, and removing timer presets.

### 2. **UI and UX Improvements**
Make sure the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly. This includes:
- **Consistent Styling**: Ensure that all UI components follow a consistent style.
- **Responsive Design**: Verify that the app looks good on different screen sizes.

### 3. **State Management**
Ensure that state management is correctly implemented using `Provider`. This includes:
- **TimerState**: Manage the timer's state, including duration, remaining time, and presets.
- **AppState**: Manage application-wide state, particularly related to database operations for timer presets.

### 4. **Database Integration**
Ensure that the database operations are correctly implemented and tested. This includes:
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement and test create, read, update, and delete operations for timer presets and settings.
- **Migration Strategy**: Ensure that the database migration strategy is correctly implemented.

### 5. **Service Integration**
Ensure that the services for notifications and audio are correctly integrated and tested. This includes:
- **NotificationService**: Test the initialization and display of notifications.
- **AudioService**: Test the playback and stopping of alarm sounds.

### 6. **Code Cleanup and Documentation**
Ensure that your code is clean and well-documented. This includes:
- **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic.
- **Refactoring**: Refactor any repetitive or complex code to improve readability and maintainability.

### Example: Completing Timer Controls
Here's an example of how you can complete the `TimerControls` widget:

```dart


import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class TimerControls extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool isRunning;
  final VoidCallback startTimer;
  final VoidCallback stopTimer;
  final VoidCallback resetTimer;
  final VoidCallback openSettings;

  const TimerControls({
    super.key,
    required this.isRunning,
    required this.startTimer,
    required this.stopTimer,
    required this.resetTimer,
    required this.openSettings,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ConstrainedBox(
      constraints: BoxConstraints(maxWidth: 400),
      child: Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
        children: [
          // Start/Pause Button
          Column(
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: isRunning ? stopTimer : startTimer,
                style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                  backgroundColor: isRunning ? Colors.amber : Colors.green,
                ),
                child: Icon(
                  isRunning ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
                  color: isRunning ? Colors.black : Colors.white,
                ),
              ),
              Text(
                isRunning ? 'Pause' : 'Run',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 10),
              ),
            ],
          ),
          // Reset Button
          Column(
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: resetTimer,
                child: Icon(Icons.replay),
              ),
              const Text(
                'Reset',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 10),
              ),
            ],
          ),
          // Settings Button
          Column(
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: openSettings,
                child: const Icon(Icons.settings),
              ),
              const Text(
                'Settings',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 10),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
