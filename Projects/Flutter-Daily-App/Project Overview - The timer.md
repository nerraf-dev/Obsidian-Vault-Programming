## Overview
This project is a Flutter application that includes a timer feature with various functionalities such as setting alarms, managing presets, and displaying countdowns. It uses several packages like `provider` for state management, `drift` for database operations, and `flutter_local_notifications` for notifications.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Entry Point
**`main.dart`**
- Initializes services like `NotificationService` and `AudioService`.
- Uses `MultiProvider` to provide these services to the app.
- Runs the `MainApp`.

### 2. Main Application
**`main_app.dart`**
- Sets up the main structure of the app using `MultiProvider` for state management.
- Configures the theme using `ThemeProvider`.
- Defines the main `MaterialApp`.

### 3. State Management
**`timer_state.dart`**
- Manages the state of the timer, including duration, remaining time, and presets.
- Handles starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
- Manages alarm settings and interactions with `NotificationService` and `AudioService`.

**`app_state.dart`**
- Manages application-wide state, particularly related to database operations for timer presets.

### 4. Database
**`app_db.dart`**
- Defines the database schema using `drift`.
- Manages CRUD operations for timer presets and settings.

### 5. Services
**`notification_service.dart`**
- Manages local notifications using `flutter_local_notifications`.

**`audio_service.dart`**
- Manages audio playback using `audioplayers`.

### 6. UI Components
**`main_screen.dart`**
- The main screen of the app, which includes navigation and different sections like Home and Timer.

**`home_screen.dart`**
- Displays a welcome message and the active timer if running.

**`timer_screen.dart`**
- The main screen for the timer feature, including controls and settings.

**`alarm_expansion_panel.dart`**
- A UI component for managing alarm settings within an expansion panel.

**`time_expansion_panel.dart`**
- A UI component for setting the timer duration within an expansion panel.

**`presets_expansion_panel.dart`**
- A UI component for managing timer presets within an expansion panel.

**`timer_display.dart`**
- Displays the remaining time in a formatted manner.

**`timer_controls.dart`**
- Provides controls to start, stop, and reset the timer.

**`timer_input_fields.dart`**
- Input fields for setting hours, minutes, and seconds for the timer.

**`preset_input_fields.dart`**
- Input fields for managing timer presets.

### 7. Navigation
**`main_nav_rail.dart`**
- A navigation rail for switching between different sections of the app.

### 8. Theme Management
**`theme_provider.dart`**
- Manages the app's theme, allowing toggling between light and dark modes.

## How It All Fits Together
- The 

main.dart

 file initializes the app and sets up the necessary services.
- 

main_app.dart

 configures the app's providers and theme.
- The `MainScreen` uses a navigation rail to switch between different sections like Home and Timer.
- The `TimerScreen` includes various widgets to control and display the timer, manage presets, and set alarms.
- State management is handled by `TimerState` and `AppState`, which interact with the database and services.
- UI components like `ExpansionPanel`, `TimerDisplay`, and `TimerControls` provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the timer.
