I was lucky enough to grow up with computers. I had my first experience with a Spectrum 48K when my dad connected it up to the portable black and white tv, popped the cassette in the separate cassette player and ran the 'guess the shape' and 'hangman' games he'd made when studying a night course on Basic.

As someone who is 'quite in to tech', enjoys sci-fi, grew up with Star Wars, Start Trek, The Jetsons etc it's probably fair to say I quite like the digital world.
