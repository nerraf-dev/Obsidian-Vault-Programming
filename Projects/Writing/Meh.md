Ah the world is fucking wonderful. It's like all those things you saw in the Jetsons and Star Trek growing up. All the best bits of the best sci-fi here making life easier and better. 

The glowing light fades away, the light hum stops, footsteps approach.

The water is at temperature. 

"Hey 'Jeeves'" a voice says sarcastically, "Play some music."
"Hi Dave, sure. Here's something to start the day" a soft, digitised voice replies as some bubbly lo-fi floats out of the speakers. *Dave* sniggers as he pops the filled phin filter onto the cup and carefully prepares his coffee. He carefully fills, packs, pours, "blooms" and packs, and pours as a machine sits in the corner, ready to make a coffee at a touch of a button. But this is almost relaxing. A way to focus. Dave sips the sweet, strong brew and looks back at the display on the wall. 22°C and sunny. He grins and thinks "No shit!" as his eyes shits to the nearby window. The sweet, 8-bit, bubbly tones in the background make the scene look like some old video game with some weirdly powered handymen stomping on wildlife. 




"This is your 5 minute reminder, Dave" the digital voice says. 
"Gonna need another 20" he replies. 
"Ok, Dave. I'll get back to you in 20 minutes." 
"I should probably change that one day" Dave says with a smirk and clears up the leftovers from the coffee adventure. Hits a couple of buttons on the wall display, as the music stops, the lights go down and the vacuum cleaner sets off, out the front door and to the elevator. 

Stepping in he looks up, remembering he completely ignored all mirrors in the apartment, seeing his reflection looking back. "Meh...this'll have to do" and the doors slide closed. 



He decants some water into a small jug and pops the small, shiny, Vietnamese coffee filter on to the glass cup. Taking more time over making the coffee than many more important things but it was almost relaxing. As the coffee slowly dips in to the waiting condensed milk, his eyes gaze at the wall display. 22°C and sunny. "No shit" the inner voice groans, eyes shifting to window just to the the left to see yet another sunny day. He prods the screen, soft lo-fi comes out of the speakers as he returns to the coffee. Mixing in the condensed milk 



"This is your 15 minute reminder, Dave" the soft, digitised voice says as the hallway light turns on.
