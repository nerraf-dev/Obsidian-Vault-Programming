that never really existed and wouldn't work with todays wants and needs.


Doomscrolling through any feed skipping over the posts of peoples food, past the holiday snaps and ignoring the adverts you'll come across something scientific or about history that's actually factual and correct but you'll also come across the posts happily looking back at products or places from a certain time period. I'm going to look at the posts about places.

These posts could be generally split into simple or 'for social media' posts and articles. You'll often see the articles posted by you're trusted local news organisations. You know the ones, those 'locally' owned and run and certainly not part of some media conglomerate. They link to a short article and photo gallery and invite you to 'take a look at your town/city centre in 1960'. The articles tend to look at things mostly from a positive (in the broadest sense) view but there are those that show the broader picture of 'life back then'. Showing and commenting on the good and the not-so-good times, showing that things were tough and not just pub gardens and Brighton beach. *There are some other posts that may link elsewhere to an 'article' or other post but usually unrelated to the typical media organisations.*

The posts made for the social media platform, the 'simple' type is often just an image along with a short comment. Sometimes there is a longer commentary, a paragraph or occasionally more. These posts are usually looking at a specific snapshot of some random time in the the past. The comment usually reflects that and more often (can I be bothered to actually count without wanting to through myself in to the sea) its something positive. "Oh look who doesn't like positive stuff" you might think or angrily type in the comments. It's not about [[not liking positivity]]; seeing a post about your teams latest win or their latest community outreach results, a kitten playing with a penguin, a kid who build a lego robot to help his hamster or whatever. But is there something more? Simply the post invokes a nostalgic response to a time gone by and the thing is this seems to happen whether you were there or not. Personally I like looking at images of my home town and other places I've called home or been able to enjoy. Looking back at where the old HMV used to be, or the first club you went to and successfully entered at 16. If that were simply the purpose, and I know that for some I believe it is, that that would be great. But I don't believe that is the case.

Ok, so my own little 'conspiracy' if you will. Call me woke, call me a luny leftie, call me crazy, tell you've "heard it before and why I am so late to the party?" but there might be just one or two that are out there to cause controversy. GASP! Yes...some of these post are just looking for engagement and if it stirs up some good old fashioned hatred then...great. 

Anyway, could just ignore this trivial little thing and move on. But sadly the old brain won't and hence these thoughts as bytes in a document. 

If you can just look at this snapshot, hopefully smile, and move on then great. But as with all social media and pretty much any site today there is the ability to comment. Can you move on without seeing...or worse, using this? If you have to look then the contents can often vary, which seems to link to where the post came from, but there almost always a common link. Wherever the post came from, whatever the place or time there always some sort of, however thinly veiled, hatred. And here you get to see, sadly it seems the worst (at lest words) of society and being amplified. Ahhh, fun.

The city snapshot

The City Pics:
Love looking at the old pictures of town. The old busses on the high street, the long demolished underpass with the newsagent and cafe. If it was of my time it invokes memories of Saturdays with school mates, nights out both legally and illegally drinking. Sometimes, depending on the place and the decade you get to see a real snapshot of actual life. I say sometimes because many UK cities for many decades have had a pretty multicultural population. As someone who likes food, you can see the influences from immigration clearly and who doesn't want to be able to choose from Caribbean/Indian/Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/add more... dishes?


and you're bound to come across a post about toys, sweets, 
be it social media or even a 'local' news site, you're bound to come across a post about something from the past.

These posts all have a lot of things in common along with a few differences. 
The time period spans anything from a couple of decades to a couple of centuries.
