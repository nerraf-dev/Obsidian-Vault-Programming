## Fish Tacos 10/04

### Ingredients:
1. White fish
2. Avocado
3. Cabbage
4. Carrot
5. Tomato
6. Onion
7. Lime juice
8. Spicy paprika
9. cumin
10. chilli flakes
11. Hot sauce
12. Pepper
13. Salt
### Method:
1. Chop up the onion and tomato, smash the avocado, slice the cabbage and grate the carrot.
2. Mix up some spices and seasoning with some lime juice. Add the lime juice a bit at a time as you want more of a paste than a dressing or sauce.
3. Coat the fish in the paste.
   I used some frozen cod for the air fryer for this attempt and will look to do another without the frozen fish at some point. The coating worked and stuck, the fish came out of the air fryer looking kind of good but I don't think the taste will really get in there. 
4. Cook off the fish, I used the air fryer and it took about twice as long as the instructions on the 'air fryer fish' packet stated. 

> [!TIP]
>    "**Air Fryer Tip**: Frozen cod works, but fresh will absorb more flavour. Cook at 180Â°C for 12-15 mins (double-check with a fork)."

5. Whilst the fish is in throw together a couple of things to chuck on the side, on the taco or with something else.
	- The avocado with lime juice, salt, pepper and chilli flakes. Chuck in a bit of the onion and the tomato too, why not, and mix yourself a rough guacamole. 
	-  Make a simple coleslaw mixing the carrot, cabbage and some of the onion (if it's fine)  with some salt, pepper, a drop of oil and vinegar.I  chuck a bit of lemon juice in there too if its about. 
6. When the fish is cooked is should break and flake apart nicely giving some good chunks to chuck in to a tortilla.
7. And on that, might want to heat the tortillas. However you'd do it is fine. If i can be bothered I try and make up some fried hardshells, this time though it was a simple heat in a hot frying pan.
8. Grab a tortilla, and stuff how you like. Chuck on some hot sauce if you fancy. 

### Budget Breakdown  
- **Cheapest swap**: Use something instead of something else.  
- **Pantry savers**: Paprika, cumin, and chilli flakes last agesâ€”worth the initial spend.  
- **Total cost**: ~Â£99999
