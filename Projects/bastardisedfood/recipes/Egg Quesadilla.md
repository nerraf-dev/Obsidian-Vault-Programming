# Egg Quesadilla
*Eggs, cheese, and whatever is left in the fridge*  

For 2
## 📝 Ingredients  
- **Protein**:  
  -  3 - 4 Eggs, beaten
  - 50g chorizo   
- **Veg**:  
  - onion, diced 
  - tomato, chopped  
  - jalapeño slices (or Spanish *guindillas*)  
- **Dairy**:  
  - grated cheese. A mature cheddar works well.
- Tortillas (2)
- **Seasoning**:  
  - Paprika, chilli, garlic, salt and pepper
- **Extras**:  
  - Hot sauce  

## 👩‍🍳 Method  
1. **Prep**:  
   - Super easy, just beat the eggs and chap/grate everything else. 

2. **Cook**:  
   - Heat a non-stick pan (medium heat).  
   - Fry chorizo off and soften it up a bit. 
    Move the chorizo to one side, remove the excess oil but I leave the pan coated/a bit in the pan as its adds something to the tortilla.
   - Put the first tortilla in the pan (med/med-low) and place the filing on one half, creating a little well in the mix.
   - Pour half the egg on to the mix, in to the well. It'll probably leak...but this ain't fancy!
   - Repeat for the second tortilla and let them cook for a few minutes before flipping over for another couple of mins to finish off. 

2. **Serve**:  
   - Spalsh the hot sauce over the top and stick on plates.
