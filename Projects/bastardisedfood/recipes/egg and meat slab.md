## Egg and Meat Slab 12/04

A circular slab of egg, meat, cheese and a little veg. The typical slab covers a couple of meals or just use a smaller pan. 
### Ingredients
- Eggs 
- Chorizo
- Ham or bacon (or anything in the fridge)
- Onion; white and spring onions
- Tomato
- Cheese, grated. A 4 cheese mix is ok, grated (extra) mature cheddar is best. 
- JalapeÃ±os
- Spicy paprika
- Cumin
- Chilli flakes
- Black pepper
- Salt
- Hot sauce
- Oil
### Method
1. If it can be chopped, chop it. Nothing has to be chopped too finely for this one. Cube the chorizo, dice the veg and slice the other meat. 
2. The eggs, beat them.
3. Heat up a pan on the hob, medium-ish heat, and then start cooking the meat.
4. Throw in the onions and you can let them soften a little before adding the tomato and the jalapeÃ±os. 
5. Add in the spices and seasoning and give it bit of a mix
6. Toss in a good handful of cheese
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and pour in the eggs and probably give it a bit of mix about to ensure a decent coverage.
8. Give it 5 or so mins and the egg should be cooking through. The top will still look a bit 'loose' and runny. I know with a 'tortilla' in Spain you'd flip the thing to cook the top. I'm too clumsy for that, so get the grill pre-heated.
9. Pop the pan under the grill to cook off the top. A couple of mins should do it. Enough so that it's no longer raw egg but not so long the things turns to concrete. Ideally you want a softish bounce to the whole thing with the centre still oozing a little.
10. Get it out, pop a plate (or something) over and flip the pan, you may need to work the edge a little first, and you should have the slab on a plate. The new top should look nicely fried and hopefully no overly 'cooked' bits. 
### Budget Breakdown  
- **Cheapest swap**: Use something instead of something else.  
- **Pantry savers**: Paprika, cumin, and chilli flakes last agesâ€”worth the initial spend.  
- **Total cost**: ~Â£99999
