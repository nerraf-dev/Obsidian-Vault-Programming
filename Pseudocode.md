Most programs are developed using programming languages and these languages have specific syntax. If that syntax is not followed correctly the program will not run properly. **Pseudocode** is not a programming language but rather a simplistic way of describing a set of instructions without using specific syntax.

### Common pseudocode notation

While there's no universally agreed-upon standard for pseudocode notation, some common conventions include:

- **INPUT:** Indicates that the user will input data.
- **OUTPUT:** Indicates that the program will display output.
- **WHILE:** A loop that continues as long as a condition is true.
- **FOR:** A loop that iterates a specific number of times.
- **REPEAT-UNTIL:** A loop that repeats until a condition becomes true.
- **IF-THEN-ELSE:** A decision-making structure that executes different code blocks based on a condition.

### Using pseudocode

Pseudocode is a valuable tool for planning and designing programs. Let's consider a simple example: a program that asks users to input their favourite subject until they answer "Computer Science."

```
REPEAT
  OUTPUT "What is your favourite class?"
  INPUT class
  IF class = "Computer Science" THEN
    OUTPUT "Excellent choice!"
  ELSE
    OUTPUT "No! Try again."
UNTIL subject = "Computer Science"
```
